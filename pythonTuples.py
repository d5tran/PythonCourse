#Tuples are immutable, meaning they can't be changed. Once an element is assigned, you can't change it
#Tuples using ()

t = (1,2,3)

my_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'a', 'c')

#Tuples have a count function where you can count how many of that object there is .count, .index('a') while find the first element of that object

print(my_tuple.count('a'))

#Tuples keep data integrity, which assigning values by accident harder to do
